i18n stands for internationalization. It is the process of designing and developing software applications that can be adapted to various languages and cultures without requiring engineering changes to the core functionality of the application.

The goal of internationalization is to create software that is flexible enough to be adapted to different locales, character sets, and cultures, so that users in different parts of the world can use the application in their native language, with the correct formatting, and with an appropriate level of cultural sensitivity.

The internationalization process involves a number of tasks, such as:

Designing the application to support localization and internationalization.
Identifying all the text, images, and other content that need to be translated.
Preparing the codebase for translation by externalizing strings, removing hard-coded values, and using locale-specific APIs and libraries.
Testing the application to ensure that it can handle all the different languages and cultures that it is intended to support.
Overall, internationalization is an important consideration for any software application that is intended to be used by people in different parts of the world, as it can greatly enhance the usability and accessibility of the application.
